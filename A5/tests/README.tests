Testing process:

~~Output~~
While developing features, we would create one of the new files,
set it as TEST.488, and use `../src/compiler488/testing/TestCodeGen.java`
to run the test. We would then move `TEST.488` to one of the other new test
files, and then give it a descriptive name.

~~Machine Code~~
We tested the specific code outputted by printing out the resulting
`ArrayList<Instruction>`, and diffing it with prewritten machine code. These
were done for very "small" test programs, like declaring one variable and
storing it, or looping and exiting directly.

One thing we should have done was regressive tests. Our `TestCodeGen.java`
should have taken a directory of files, ran the compiler on each of those files,
and outputted the failures/passes in some nice format.

The following test cases each cover C00-C04

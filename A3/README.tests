The tests are designed to check every Semantic attribute, S00-S53. We split
them into passing test files and failing test files to differentiate, and kept the files
small so they only test one thing.

--Usage--
To run all of the tests, do 
    `sh RUNTESTS.sh`
To run a test on one file, and output to another, run
    `sh RUNTESTS.sh <input> <output>`
Otherwise it will output to STDOUT if no output is given, by running
    `sh RUNTESTS.sh <input>`

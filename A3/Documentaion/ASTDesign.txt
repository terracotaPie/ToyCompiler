-- AST Design --
 
For the AST design, we augmented the AST files given to us by adding a
different type, and implementing some new functions (and fixing some weird
toString and indentation statements). For the cup file, we just added  a 1-1
mapping between `compiler488.ast.*` and the grammar. So we gave each
nonterminal a type and defined the actions accordingly.

-- Semantic Analysis Design --

We do a depth-first walk of the AST to perform the semantic analysis by
enforcing the semantic checks listed in the assignment pdf. Every child of an
AST was augmented with a semantic visit function to facilitate this. For type
checking, AST nodes were tagged with the symbol type enum (described in Symbol
Table Design) which we used for type tagging to differentiate between function
and prodecures to implement the proper semantic checks.  We also propogate
errors through an error list in the semanticObjects class which contains
helpful error information and messages. Scope conflics are resolved in the
symbol table.

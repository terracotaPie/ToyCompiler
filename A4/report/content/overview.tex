\section{Overview}
We will walk the AST generated in A3 to create code in A5.

\subsection{Visitor Pattern}
When building the AST (A3), we chose to implement an \texttt{ast\_visit} method
for each type of node within the class for that node. For A5, we will
instead choose to use a visitor pattern. This provides cleaner code that can be
easily swapped and adjusted. We will have a \texttt{CodeGenVisitor} class that
defines how code is generated for each type of AST node. We will also create a
\texttt{LHSVisitor} class to generate code for the left-hand side of assignment
statements (\texttt{:=}).

\subsection{Termination}
We handle termination by processing HALT.

\subsection{Initialization}
We must initialzie our program counter and pointers. The PC is set to 0, the MSP
is set to point to the start of the stack, and the MLP is set to point to the memory
chunk just before constants.

\section{Overview}
We will walk the AST generated in A3 to create code in A5.

\subsection{Visitor Pattern}
When building the AST (A3), we chose to implement an \texttt{ast\_visit} method
for each type of node within the class for that node. For A5, we will
instead choose to use a visitor pattern. This provides cleaner code that can be
easily swapped and adjusted. We will have a \texttt{CodeGenVisitor} class that
defines how code is generated for each type of AST node. We will also create a
\texttt{LHSVisitor} class to generate code for the left-hand side of assignment
statements (\texttt{:=}).

\subsection{Termination}
We handle termination by processing HALT.

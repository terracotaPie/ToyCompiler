\subsection{Variables}
  Variables are either free or bound in any particular scope. We say a variable
  is bound if it is declared in that scope, otherwise it is free.

  \begin{code}[Bound vs Free]
  {
    var x:Integer // x bound
    {
      var y:Integer // y bound
      x:= 1 // x free
    }
  }
  \end{code}

  Because our AST checks that every free variable has been declared, all free
  variables are declared \textit{somewhere}. We will augment our symbol table
  from A3 to now include offsets.
\subsubsection{Main}
  When entering the program scope, we will calculate the size required for all
  the variables and allocate space accordingly.
